    </h4>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½–2 cups cooked day-old jasmine rice</li>
        <li>6–8 medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1–2 stalks green onion, finely sliced</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1–2 tbsp neutral oil</li>
        <li>1–1½ tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>Salt and white or black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 lime wedge</li>
        <li>Optional: a pinch of sugar or a splash of fish sauce for depth</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If your rice is freshly cooked, spread it out and let it cool, or refrigerate briefly so the grains dry out slightly (this helps prevent mushy fried rice).</li>
        <li>Heat a wok or large pan over high heat and add about 1 tbsp oil. Add the shrimp, season lightly with salt, and sear just until pink and opaque. Remove and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add a little more oil to the pan if needed, then pour in the beaten egg. Let it set briefly, then scramble into small pieces and push to one side of the pan.</li>
        <li>Add garlic to the empty side of the pan and stir for about 10–15 seconds until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the rice to the pan. Break up any clumps and stir-fry for 2–3 minutes so the rice gets lightly toasted.</li>
        <li>Drizzle in the soy sauce (and sesame oil if using), tossing everything to coat evenly. Adjust with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Return the cooked shrimp to the pan, add most of the green onions, and toss briefly to combine.</li>
        <li>Pack the fried rice lightly into a small bowl or mold, invert onto a plate if you want the dome shape, and finish with remaining green onions and a lime wedge on the side.</li>
    </ol>
