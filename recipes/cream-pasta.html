    </h4>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>120–150 g dried fettuccine</li>
        <li>6–8 medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>½ cup sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½–¾ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1–2 tbsp unsalted butter or olive oil</li>
        <li>2–3 tbsp grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to package directions until al dente; reserve a little cooking water before draining.</li>
        <li>In a large pan over medium heat, melt the butter (or heat the oil), then sauté the garlic for about 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until softened and lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Add the shrimp to the pan and cook just until pink and opaque; season lightly with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat and pour in the heavy cream, stirring gently; let it simmer briefly to thicken slightly.</li>
        <li>Stir in the Parmesan until melted and smooth. If the sauce looks too thick, add a small splash of the reserved pasta water.</li>
        <li>Add the drained pasta to the pan and toss to coat evenly in the creamy sauce.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a plate or bowl and finish with chopped parsley and extra black pepper if desired.</li>
    </ol>
